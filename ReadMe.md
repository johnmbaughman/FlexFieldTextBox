# A Refreshed C# Numeric Field Control

![demoscreenshot](/docs/images/DemoScreenshot.png)

This abstract control is from an article by mid=5741 on [Code Project](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19095/A-C-Numeric-Field-Control) from 2008 originally written in .Net 2.0. I needed these controls for another top-secret project and decided to give them a try. Lo and behold, .Net 7 doesn't like .Net 2.0. Go figure. Hence, the time was taken to move things over to .Net 7 and WinForms as well as "modernize" the code for the year 2023. 

For a copy of the original CodeProject doc, look no further than [here](/docs/a-c-numeric-field-control.md).

The only credit taken by me is the port to .Net 7. All other work is owned by the original author.
